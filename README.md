# 90-Days-Algorithm
One or more algorithm solutions for each day for 90 days!

## Description
Hello everyone. This is a repo I created to ensure my own 
development and continuity. Here I will put one or more algorithm 
solutions every day for 90 days without interruption. I always wanted 
to solve better algorithms. With this series, I aim to improve that. 
I'll be pondering the 'easy' algorithms on LeetCode for the first 30 
days, the 'medium' algorithms for the next 30 days, and the 'hard' 
algorithms for the last 30 days. There is more than one solution 
for each algorithm, one of which is my own.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* You must have Java 11 or higher.
* 

### Executing program

## Help

If there is a problem, you can contact me through the issue section. 
In addition, if there is a place that is not understood for the 
algorithms you 
have studied or you would like me to explain, please do not hesitate.
